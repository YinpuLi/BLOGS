# Writing in Markdown 101

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/YinpuLi/blogs/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

## Text Font Formatting
- To make a phrase _italic_ in Markdown, you can surround words with one underscore or one asterisk on each side of the pharse;
- To make a phrase **bold** in Markdown, you can surround words with two asterisks on both sides;
- To make a pharase ***both italics and bold***, you can surround words with three asterisks on both sides.

## Headers

There are six types of headers, in decreasing sizes:

# Header level 1
## Header level 2
### Header level 3
#### Header level 4
##### Header level 5
###### Header level 6

You simply place the same number of hash marks as the size of the header you want.

## Links

There are two different link types. 
- The first link style is called an _inline link_. To create an inline link, you wrap the link text in brackets, and then wrap the link in parenthesis. 
- The other link is called a _reference_ link, where the link is actually a reference to another place in the document. To create a reference link, you wrap the link text in one pair of brackets, and then wrap the reference text in a second pair of brackets. At the bottom of a Markdown documentm the reference texts are defined as proper links to outside websites, in the form of the same tag name wrapped in brackets, followed by a colon, followed by the link.

## Images

The syntax for creating images is nearly the same as for links. Images also have two styles, just like links, and both of them render exactly the same way. The only difference is that the images are prefaced with an exclamation point.


## Blockquotes

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/YinpuLi/blogs/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
